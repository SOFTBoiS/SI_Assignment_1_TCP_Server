 * 1. Create a server socket and bind it to a specific port number
 * 2. Listen for a connection from the client and accept it. This results in a client socket, created on the server, for the connection.
 * 3. Read data from the client via an InputStream obtained from the client socket
 * 4. Send data to the client via the client socketâ€™s OutputStream.
 * 5. Close the connection with the client.
 * <p>
 * The steps 3 and 4 can be repeated many times depending on the protocol agreed between the server and the client.
